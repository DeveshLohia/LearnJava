String
	StringBuilder
		1. Helps in making mutable String
		2. Works better if size given in advance.
			StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(40);
		3. sb.capacity() -> 40
		4. append (appends at the end)and insert (adds in between)
			sb.append("I flew to ");
			String location = "Delhi";
			ab.append(location);
